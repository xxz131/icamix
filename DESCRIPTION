Description: The icamix package provides R functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the estimation of ICA mixture models. We have developed and implemented the NSMM-ICA algorithm in the function EMFASTICAALG that currently integrates npEM and Fast-ICA for non-parametric estimation of ICA mixture models.
